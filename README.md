# ML-Agents Air Hockey AI Project

This repository showcases the training of AI for a CPU opponent in an air hockey game using Unity's ML-Agents. The project features two modes:

- **Player vs CPU**: Compete against the trained AI.
- **CPU vs CPU**: Watch two AI opponents face off against each other.
